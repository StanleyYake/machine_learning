%% Machine Learning Online Class - Exercise 3 | Part 1: One-vs-all


% My notes:
% Program utilizes 5000 rows of 20x20 pixels, thus a 5000x400 matrix of 
% image data as the training set. Y is the output for the training set
% 1-500 = 0, 501-1000=2, 1001-1500=3, etc.
% oneVsAll calculates the classifiers (all_theta) given 500 entries of
% each digit as the training set.
%
% After classifer is determined, we use predictOneVsAll to test the 
% accuracy of the classifiers.


%  Instructions
%  ------------
% 
%  This file contains code that helps you get started on the
%  linear exercise. You will need to complete the following functions 
%  in this exericse:
%
%     lrCostFunction.m (logistic regression cost function)
%     oneVsAll.m
%     predictOneVsAll.m
%     predict.m
%
%  For this exercise, you will not need to change any code in this file,
%  or any other files other than those mentioned above.
%

%% Initialization
clear ; close all; clc

%% Setup the parameters you will use for this part of the exercise
input_layer_size  = 400;  % 20x20 Input Images of Digits
num_labels = 10;          % 10 labels, from 1 to 10   
                          % (note that we have mapped "0" to label 10)

%% =========== Part 1: Loading and Visualizing Data =============
%  We start the exercise by first loading and visualizing the dataset. 
%  You will be working with a dataset that contains handwritten digits.
%

% Load Training Data
fprintf('Loading and Visualizing Data ...\n')

load('ex3data1.mat'); % training data stored in arrays X, y
m = size(X, 1);

% Randomly select 100 data points to display
rand_indices = randperm(m);
sel = X(rand_indices(1:100), :);


% sel = X(1001:1500,:);	% Display 2 
% sel = X(1501:2000,:); % Display 3
displayData(sel);

fprintf('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
% pause;

%% ============ Part 2: Vectorize Logistic Regression ============
%  In this part of the exercise, you will reuse your logistic regression
%  code from the last exercise. You task here is to make sure that your
%  regularized logistic regression implementation is vectorized. After
%  that, you will implement one-vs-all classification for the handwritten
%  digit dataset.
%

fprintf('\nTraining One-vs-All Logistic Regression...\n')

lambda = 0.1;
[all_theta] = oneVsAll(X, y, num_labels, lambda);

% fprintf('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
% pause;


%% ================ Part 3: Predict for One-Vs-All ================
%  After ...
pred = predictOneVsAll(all_theta, X);

fprintf('\nTraining Set Accuracy: %f\n', mean(double(pred == y)) * 100);
